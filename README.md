# LADDS - Large-scale Deterministic Debris Simulation

Codebase for the ARIADNA Study between TU Munich and ESA's Advanced Concepts Team. A more detailed project description can be found on the [Advanced Concept Team's webpage](https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/projects/debris_hpc/).

## Requirements
* CMake >= 3.19
* make (build-essentials, or equivalent)
* A C++17 Compiler (recommended: gcc >=7 or clang >=8, only clang-10 is tested)
* OpenMP >= 4.5
* git (for fetching dependencies)
* [TBB](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneTBB) (Breakup-Model needs this)

### Optional
* Doxygen
* clang-format-9

## Building
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
CC=clang CXX=clang++ ccmake ..  # Set Variables according to your preferences
make -j12                       # choose number according to your CPU
```

## Testing
Testing is done with help of [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest), which is downloaded by CMake.
```bash
cmake -DLADDS_BUILD_TESTS=ON .. # Should be enabled by default
make ladds_tests -j12
ctest -j12
```

## Calibrating AutoPas
By default, some robust but static configuration is set by LADDS. You can change this by specifying the
algorithmic options AutoPas is allowed to use in the YAML file. If more than one configuration can be built
from these options AutoPas will tune over them at run time.

### Enable Auto Tuning
If you are unsure what algorithmic configuration you want to use for AutoPas just let AutoPas guide you.
For this, the following needs be activated in the `yaml` file:
```yaml
autopas:
  tuningMode: true
```
In this mode, the simulation is only executed for one AutoPas tuning-phase. At the end of this phase, a copy
of the full configuration is created, which contains the algorithm configuration that AutoPas deemed to be
the fastest. This configuration can then be used to run the actual simulation at optimal speed.

### Analyzing AutoPas Configurations
AutoPas can be compiled to dump information about the performance of the algorithms it uses to `.csv` files. 
For this set the CMake variables:  `AUTOPAS_LOG_TUNINGDATA=ON` and `AUTOPAS_LOG_TUNINGRESULTS=ON`.
* `AutoPas_tuningData.csv` contains the timing data of all samples AutoPas collected.
* `AutoPas_tuningResults.csv` contains the result of each tuning phase.

## Processing TLE Input 
Data on current satellites etc. is often found [online](https://www.space-track.org/) in the [TLE format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-line_element_set). We include a Jupyter notebook which can be used to process TLE data with pykep to create and analyze suitable datasets. Detailed instructions can be found in the notebook in `notebooks/Data Processing.ipynb`.

## Generating Constellation Input
Satellite constellations (e.g. Starlink, OneWeb) are usually described by a list of orbital shells.
An orbital shell is described by a 4-tuple with information about `altitude`, `inclination`, `number of
planes`, and `number of satellites` per plane. We provide a notebook 
`notebooks/ConstellationGeneration/ConstellationGeneration.ipynb` that can be used 
to generate constellation data from orbital shell parameters.

Quick guide:
* Initialize the constellation by executing the first cell and providing metadata in the second cell (1)
* create a shell by providing the 4 shell arguments, and further parameters (extra params) if necessary (2.1).
Store the temporary shell data by executing the cell (2.2)
* turn satellites into position and velocity vectors by executing cell (3)
* write the files by executing cell (4) and save them by executing cell (5)

A detailed guide is located in the directory of the notebook.

## Output

LADDS has multiple options for output that can be (de)activated mostly independent of each other via YAML. See `cfg/default_cfg.yaml` for relevant options.

### VTK
`.vtu` files in XML/ASCII layout that can be loaded into [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) for visualization.

### HDF5
A single `.h5` containing particle and conjunction data from a full simulation run with the following structure:
```
/
├── CollisionData
│   └── <IterationNr>
│       └── (Dataset) Collisions
│           idA idB distanceSquared
└── ParticleData
    └── <IterationNr>
        └── Particles
            ├── (Dataset) IDs
            ├── (Dataset) Positions
            │   x y z
            └── (Dataset) Velocities
                x y z
```

Collision data is tracked every iteration, particle data only in intervals that are defined in the YAML file. To keep file size reasonable compression is supported.

### CSV
If HDF5 output is disabled entirely, collision data is written in a `.csv` file in ASCII layout.
