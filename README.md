## Building
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
CC=clang CXX=clang++ ccmake ..  # Set Variables according to your preferences
make -j12                       # choose number according to your CPU
```

## Testing
Testing is done with help of [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest), which is downloaded by CMake.
```bash
cmake -DLADDS_BUILD_TESTS=ON .. # Should be enabled by default
make ladds_tests -j12
ctest -j12
```
